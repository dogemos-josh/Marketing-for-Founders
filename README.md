Let’s face it. Marketing is tough, especially if you’re a technical founder moving the first steps with your startup.

While there’s a ton of advice out there, most of the time it's about scaling some VC-funded startup with a big marketing budget to $1,000,000 ARR and 100,000 users.

Inspirational? Sure. Actionable? Not really.

This is why you’ll find here a practical collection of startup resources, tips, and some tools to help you:
- 🎯 find the first users for your startup
- 📣 promote your SaaS without a budget
- 🚀 build your Go-To-Market strategy

## 📷 Social Media Marketing
Managing multiple accounts across all social media platforms can be pretty intense (there’s a reason why it’s a full-time job); however, there are a couple of strategies worth trying: building in public and social listening.

**Building in Public** - it’s the easiest social media marketing tactic. In a nutshell, it’s about using your personal profile to share expertise, product updates, and behind-the-scenes content:

**Social listening** - tracking and joining online conversations on topics related to your Startup is pretty helpful to get in touch with users and learn more about them:

## ❄ Sales & Cold Outreach
Most people hate cold outreach and everything connected with direct sales. Yes, depending on your approach, it might be hard to scale and time-intensive, but cold emails and DMs are the most straightforward way to get in touch with potential users, collect precious early-stage feedback and find the first customers for your startup.

So, how can you find people on target? What should you write in your messages? And how can you scale cold outreach?

## 📈 SEO
Should you focus on SEO in the early days of your startup? Probably not, SEO takes time (and backlinks), but this doesn’t mean you should neglect it either.

SEO is the foundation for many startups, and it can get you a steady source of traffic without having to spend anything other than the time to do it.

These guides and tips will help you get started:

## 🤖 LLM SEO, AEO, GEO
How to get recommended by ChatGPT, Claude, Perplexity, and Gemini is probably the most popular question from founders in 2025. And it’s easy to understand why, you can get mentioned by a citation tomorrow and start showing up immediately, even if you’re an early-stage startup. 

So, where can you learn how to get found in AI search?

<br/><br/><br/>

## 🦊 Marketing on Reddit
Everyone says Reddit is the go-to platform to get initial traction and the first users for your product. There’s a community for almost every topic, plus more and more people (and LLMs) are using it to bypass SEO garbage and find what real humans actually think.

But Redditors have an almost supernatural ability to detect marketing, and when founders try to sneak in promotional content, it gets downvoted into oblivion (if you’re lucky).

So, how to promote an App/SaaS/Startup on Reddit without getting banned?

## 💌 Email Marketing
Email marketing can help you with almost anything: onboarding new users, boosting free-to-paid conversions, promoting affiliate/referral programs, and collecting feedback. Plus, it’s often your only option to engage users outside of your product.

- [How we built our onboarding email flow - PostHog](https://posthog.com/blog/how-we-built-email-onboarding)

<br/><br/><br/>

## 🧲 Content Marketing
Just like SEO, content marketing is one of the first growth levers to pull for a startup. This time, instead of creating content to praise search engines, you’ll be sharing it where your audience hangs out and hijacking trends for free exposure:
- [Getting PR for your SaaS](https://1millionarr.substack.com/p/getting-pr-for-your-saas)
- [A how-to guide for writing original content that works](https://web.archive.org/web/20250621232540/https://www.growthunhinged.com/p/you-need-a-better-content-strategy)

<br/><br/><br/>

## 💸 Ads
Every startup will think about adding a paid channel to their marketing strategy sooner or later and Ads are one of the best ways to accelerate user acquisition.

Here are a few guides to help you avoid burning through your budget before getting any return from your Ad campaign:
- [How to get started with Google Ads for early-stage B2B SaaS startups](https://www.mrrunlocked.com/p/google-ads-guide)
- [The No-Fluff LinkedIn Ads Playbook](https://knowledge.gtmstrategist.com/p/the-no-fluff-linkedin-ads-playbook)

<br/><br/><br/>

## 👩‍🏫 Influencer Marketing
Going where the audience is is the first rule of marketing. That’s why partnering with content creators and influencers can help you grow your startup and connect directly with customers.

However, online advice on influencer marketing is often bad and outdated, so let’s take a look at a few firsthand experiences:
- [Should Influencers be part of your GTM Strategy?](https://knowledge.gtmstrategist.com/p/should-influencers-be-part-of-your)
- [Short Form Playbook from Jenny AI](https://www.starterstory.com/10m-playbook?utm_source=youtube&utm_campaign=10msaasplaybook) (also watch this [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcCnqLBhvXY))

- [5 Pillars of Successful Influencer Marketing Campaigns](https://knowledge.gtmstrategist.com/p/5-pillars-of-successful-influencer-marketing-campaigns)

<br/><br/><br/>

## 💑 Affiliates and Referrals
Word-of-mouth is often the main growth driver for bootstrapped startups. Why? Because affiliate and referral programs are easy to set up, cheap (you only pay if the user converts), and build trust and credibility (when users recommend your product, you’re not only getting traffic, but also social proof that it works).

- [8 Affiliate & Referral Email Examples](https://pin.it/5BxRb4Zv4)

<br/><br/><br/>

## 🛠 Free-Tool Marketing
Free mini tools are your best bet on going viral, generating PR coverage and backlinks, and driving a ton of organic traffic. Plus, it doesn’t feel like marketing (that’s the reason why it’s also called Engineering as Marketing).

<br/><br/><br/>

## 🎯 Landing Pages, Messaging and Positioning
Most startup websites are ineffective. They fail to tell who the product is for, what the product does, and why it is better. This means confused visitors, poor conversion rates, and wasted marketing $$$.

Here are a few resources to turn your website into a sales and marketing asset:

## 🎰 Pricing
_“Your product delivers the value added to target customers; with pricing, we capture added value back to build a sustainable business.”_

Confused? You’re not alone. Pricing and business model are the toughest things to crack for a startup.

Here are a few frameworks to get your price right:

## 💡 Idea Validation
One of the most common and painful mistakes you can make is having an idea and immediately spending all your time building a product without validating demand first.

Some ideas are great, but most aren’t worth your time. So, how can you validate a startup idea?

## ⚗ User Research
_Talk to your customers! They’ll let you know what to build, what to improve, and what to leave alone!_

Sure, but when you’re running a SaaS/App, customers sign up by themselves, learn how to use your product on their own, and only reach out if they need help or support.

So, how do you get feedback? Here are a few resources to get you started:
